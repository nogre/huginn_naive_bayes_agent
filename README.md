# NaiveBayesAgent

The Huginn Naive Bayes agent uses some incoming Events as a training set for Naive Bayes Machine Learning. Then it classifies Events from other sources accordingly using tags. Acts as a Huginn Agent front end to the NBayes gem (https://github.com/oasic/nbayes).

## Installation

Add this string to your Huginn's .env `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` configuration:

```ruby
huginn_naive_bayes_agent
# when only using this agent gem it should look like hits:
ADDITIONAL_GEMS=huginn_naive_bayes_agent
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

Running `rake` will clone and set up Huginn in `spec/huginn` to run the specs of the Gem in Huginn as if they would be build-in Agents. The desired Huginn repository and branch can be modified in the `Rakefile`:

```ruby
HuginnAgent.load_tasks(branch: '<your branch>', remote: 'https://github.com/<github user>/huginn.git')
```

Make sure to delete the `spec/huginn` directory and re-run `rake` after changing the `remote` to update the Huginn source code.

After the setup is done `rake spec` will only run the tests, without cloning the Huginn source again.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
